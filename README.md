description:
     This project will help faculty to manage the student quizzes records. Faculty can also monitor if the student already has taken the quiz and how many students have already taken the quiz.
Faculty can create questions as much as he/she wants and answerable by choosing four options. Quizzes are restricted to the selected students who are listed by the faculty.

The student can immediately know his/her score after submitting the quiz and also can review their answer sheet to know which question they answered wrong and right.
